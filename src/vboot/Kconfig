config CUSTOM_MUSIC
	bool "Allow the board file to override the default firmware sound tones"
	default n
	help
	  By default depthcharge waits for 30 seconds and beeps twice
	  during the developer mode screen. If CUSTOM_MUSIC is defined, the
	  note array can be overridden and custom tones and delays could be
	  played. A useful example of this is for lengthening the developer
	  mode screen. VbExGetMusicPtr() and VbExMaxMusicSize() must be
	  implemented (in order to provide the particular music data) in the
	  board file when CUSTOM_MUSIC is enabled.

config DETACHABLE
	bool "Whether the device is a detachable"
	default n
	help
	  Enable detachable navigation (power button + vol up/down) in menu UI.

config DIAGNOSTIC_UI
	bool "Enable UI to allow boot of diagnostic rom"
	default n
	help
	  Enable option to run a diagnostic rom at boot.

config EC_SOFTWARE_SYNC
	bool "Enable EC software sync"
	default n
	help
	  EC software sync is a mechanism where the AP helps the EC verify its
	  firmware similar to how vboot verifies the main system firmware. This
	  option selects whether depthcharge should support EC software sync.

config AUXFW_SOFTWARE_SYNC
	bool "Enable auxiliary FW software sync"
	default n
	help
	  Auxiliary FW (auxfw) sync is a mechanism where the AP ensures that
	  all auxfw devices are running the specified version of firmware.
	  This is normally done for TCPCs connected to the EC. This option
	  selects whether depthcharge should support auxfw sync.

config EC_SLOW_UPDATE
	bool "EC update is slow and needs to display a screen"
	default n
	depends on EC_SOFTWARE_SYNC
	help
	  Whether the EC (or PD) is slow to update and needs to display a
	  screen that informs the user the update is happening.

config EC_EFS
	bool "Early-firmware selection (EFS) EC"
	default n
	depends on EC_SOFTWARE_SYNC
	help
	  CrosEC can support EFS: Early Firmware Selection. If it's enabled,
	  software sync need to also support it. This setting tells vboot to
	  perform EFS software sync.

config PHYSICAL_PRESENCE_KEYBOARD
	bool "Use keyboard to confirm physical presence"
	default y
	help
	  Whether to confirm physical presence using keyboard.

config MOCK_TPM
	bool "Mock the TPM in vboot (TURN OFF BEFORE RELEASE)"
	default n
	help
	  Make vboot pretend that all TPM accesses and checks are successful
	  without actually talking to the TPM. This option can be used during
	  development, or when the current TPM is known to be broken somehow.
	  THIS SHOULD NOT BE LEFT ON FOR PRODUCTION DEVICES.

choice
	prompt "Type of vboot nvdata backend"
	help
	  Where depthcharge should store vboot's nvdata.

config NVDATA_CMOS
	bool "CMOS"
	depends on ARCH_X86
	help
	  nvdata is stored in CMOS.

config NVDATA_FLASH
	bool "Flash"
	help
	  nvdata is stored in the same flash device with the firmware,
	  location determined by the fmap 'rw-nvram' entry.

endchoice

choice
	prompt "Crossystem data mechanism"
	default CROSSYSTEM_STUB
	help
	  The mechanism for passing data to crossystem.

config CROSSYSTEM_STUB
	bool "stub"

config CROSSYSTEM_ACPI
	bool "ACPI"

config CROSSYSTEM_FDT
	bool "FDT"

endchoice

config BOOT_EXTERNAL_ON_DEV
	bool "Enable boot from external disk when switching to dev mode"
	default n
	help
	  When switching to dev from normal, set the nvdata flag which allows
	  booting from external disk.  (Suitable for headless devices.)
