config DRIVER_EC_PS8751_FLASH_WINDOW

	default n
	help
	  Enables an alternate scheme for accessing the internal flash
	  of PS8xxx series TCPCs to achieve 10x faster firmware
	  updates. The TCPC presents a 256 byte window onto the internal
	  flash that can be used to read/write its content. For most
	  PS8xxx family members, the I2C bus must operate at 400 kHz (or
	  below) for this to work reliably, so this feature depends on
	  being able to adjust the I2C bus speed at runtime, so make
	  sure this capability is supported by the EC.

config DRIVER_EC_PS8751_I2C_SPEED_CONTROL
	bool "PS8xxx I2C bus speed control"
	default y if DRIVER_EC_PS8751_FLASH_WINDOW
	default n
	help
	  Enable controlling the I2C bus speed between the EC and the
	  TCPC. This is needed to potentially decrease the bus speed to
	  400 KHz to support the window based firmware update scheme.
	  If the I2C bus is normally configured to run at (or below) 400
	  KHz, this is not required.
