/*
 * This is a driver for the TI LP5562 (http://www.ti.com/product/lp5562),
 * driving a tri-color LED.
 *
 * The only connection between the LED and the main board is an i2c bus.
 *
 * This driver imitates a depthcharge display device. On initialization the
 * driver sets up the controllers to prepare them to accept programs to run.
 *
 * When a certain vboot state needs to be indicated, the program for that
 * state is loaded into the controllers, resulting in the state appropriate
 * LED behavior.
