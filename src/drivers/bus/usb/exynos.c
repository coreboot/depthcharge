 * This is an ugly hack to work around a hardware bug in the Exynos5420. They
 * changed the silicon process from 32nm to 28nm after the 5250 and forgot to
 * adjust the Loss of Signal bias and Vboost levels of the SuperSpeed PHY
 * accordingly. We can override those values at runtime, but we have to redo it
 * every time the xHC is reset (which currently happens once in
 * dc_usb_initialize()), and we have to use this clunky CR-port register
 * interface to do it. See http://crosbug.com/p/19989
