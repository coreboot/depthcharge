	bool "Disable Intel Lynxpoint EHCI"
	default n
	depends on ARCH_X86
	help
	  This driver will issue an SMI callback to coreboot that will
	  route all USB ports to the XHCI controller and disable the EHCI
	  controller to save power.

	  Select this to enable support for the Intel USB Type-C subsystem
	  (TCSS). A board_tcss_get_port_mapping() function must be provided to
	  determine the system port mapping. Currently, this driver is
	  applicable to Tiger Lake and Alder Lake systems.

	  to configure the mux and there is no need to query the EC to get port mapping and send
	  commands to PMC to configure the mux.
