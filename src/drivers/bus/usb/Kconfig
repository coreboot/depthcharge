config DRIVER_LYNXPOINT_NO_EHCI
	bool "Disable Intel Lynxpoint EHCI"
	default n
	depends on ARCH_X86
	help
	  This driver will issue an SMI callback to coreboot that will
	  route all USB ports to the XHCI controller and disable the EHCI
	  controller to save power.

	bool "Enable Intel TCSS driver"
	default n
	depends on DRIVER_EC_CROS
	depends on DRIVER_SOC_INTEL_PMC
	help
	  Select this to enable support for the Intel USB Type-C subsystem
	  (TCSS). A board_tcss_get_port_mapping() function must be provided to
	  determine the system port mapping. Currently, this driver is
	  applicable to Tiger Lake and Alder Lake systems.

config INTEL_TCSS_USE_PDC_PMC_MUX_CONFIG
	bool "Enable TCSS PDC PMC Mux configuration"
	default n
	help
	  Select this to indicate PDC<->PMC direct connection. PDC communicates directly to PMC
	  to configure the mux and there is no need to query the EC to get port mapping and send
	  commands to PMC to configure the mux.

config DRIVER_NO_INTEL_TCSS
	bool "Disable Intel TCSS driver"
	default n
	help
	  Select this to indicate that the platform doesn't have any Intel USB Type-C subsystem
