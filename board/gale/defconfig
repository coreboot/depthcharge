# Documentation/arm/Booting says:
#  The kernel should be placed in the first 128MiB of RAM. It is recommended
#  that it is loaded above 32MiB in order to avoid the need to relocate prior
#  to decompression, which will make the boot process slightly faster.
# KERNEL_START is where the (compressed) kernel blob is loaded.
